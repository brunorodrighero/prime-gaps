# Prime Gaps Analysis Tool

This software was made to provide data for the analysis of the behaviour of the prime gaps sequence of numbers.

## C# Methods

All the methods used are in the RegrasDenegocio folder, TodosOsMetodos.cs . They include all that is needed to check if a number is prime, generating the prime numbers sequence, as well as generating the prime gaps sequence, the distance between their elements and many other tools.
